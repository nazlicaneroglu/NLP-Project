# NLP-Project

The aim of this report is to analyse the OSDG dataset consisting of abstracts stemming from various documents and 17 sustainability goals which are used as labels. The data-set contains manually labeled text documents related to policy, research, and news reports which in total is derived from over 3000 documents.  As the topic of sustainability is becoming more important as many of the 17 goals have still not been
fulfilled, this topic caught our attention and we decided to model sustainability goals with natural language processing techniques in order to figure out to what extend each of those 17 topics are acknowledged in a big dataset. That’s why, our research question is ”How well do the topics generated by early NLP methods align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations?”. We performed descriptive analysis, topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and applied BERT finetuning and utilized BERT embeddings. We also employed k-means clustering with and without principal component analysis on the BERT embeddings with label prediction as the objective.
