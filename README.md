# NLP-Project

Each week you will present the findings of the previous week. Together these findings form the basis of your report:
Introduce your case, present (cleaned) data (week 1)
Formulate research question (week 2)
Perform LDA (week 3)
Word embeddings (week 4)
Pooling and attention (transformers) (week 5)
BERT and/or predictive modeling (week 6)
You need to include arguments in the report, to use plots to clarify your results, and the results should be reported in a concise manner in essay format (max 15 pages excl appendices).
